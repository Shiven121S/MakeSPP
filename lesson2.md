**The button is a relatively simple concept.**

**When unpressed, the button blocks the flow of the circuit.**

**When pressed, the button completes the circuit. Remember to put the pins of the button as pictured above as rotating it 90 degrees will cause your circuit to not function.**

**In this image, when the button is pressed, energy from the red wire flows to the black wire. When the button isnâ€™t pressed, the circuit does not flow at all.**
