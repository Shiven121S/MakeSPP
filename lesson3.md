**This is a potentiometer. It works by taking in power, and releasing power based on how far the dial is turned. If the dial is turned all the way to the left, the potentiometer restricts power entirely, and when turned all the way to the right, the potentiometer allows almost all power to move on.**

**As you can see, the potentiometer has 3 pins. The leftmost pin must be connected to ground to function properly. The rightmost pin takes in power. And the middle pin transmits power on to the next component in the circuit. These pins must be used as such or the potentiometer wonâ€™t function.**
